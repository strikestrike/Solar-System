# Solar-System
This project aims to create a web application for solar installation companies and their customers to keep track of the status and history of installed converters. 
The application will use a REST API provided by converter companies such as SMA to retrieve information about the converters. 
The application will have functionality for CRUD operations for customers, companies, converters, and tickets, and will include features such as automatic creation of tickets based on events in the converter and notifications for customers and companies when expectations for converter performance are not met. Stakeholders include installation companies, customers, and a global admin. 
The application will be built with TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, an ORM of the developer's choice, and PostgreSQL for the backend, and HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Svelte for the frontend.
